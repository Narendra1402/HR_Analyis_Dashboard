# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard that helps stakeholders monitor, evaluate, and improve human resource performance metrics across the organization.



## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal of this dashboard is to provide a 360-degree view of workforce metrics including headcount trends, hiring and termination patterns, salary analysis, demographics, job roles, and work-life balance—all aimed at supporting data-driven HR decisions.



## ❗ Problem Overview

Organizations often struggle to consolidate and analyze employee-related data from multiple sources. HR teams need efficient, visual, and dynamic tools to:
- Track employee lifecycle events (hires, promotions, terminations)
- Monitor workforce demographics and diversity
- Analyze compensation and performance trends
- Understand reasons behind attrition and dissatisfaction

This project addresses these gaps by creating an interactive and insightful HR dashboard using Power BI.



## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection** – Gathered raw HR data from CSV/Excel sources.
2. **Power Query Transformations** – Cleaned and normalized data tables (employees, hires, terminations, salaries).
3. **Data Modeling** – Built relationships among tables using star schema.
4. **DAX Measures** – Created custom KPIs (Average Salary, Gender Ratio, Termination Rate, etc.).
5. **Dashboard Design** – Used slicers, cards, clustered charts, donut charts, and KPIs for interactive reports.
6. **Performance Optimization** – Ensured smooth slicing and filtering through optimized queries and models.



## 📌 Key Features

- **Overview Dashboard**: Quick KPIs on headcount, salary, hires, terminations, and workforce breakdown.
- **Salary Analysis**: Insights into average salaries by department, education, and job role, plus gender-based pay visualization.
- **Demographics Dashboard**: Breakdown of workforce by age group, gender, marital status, and work-life balance.
- **Hires Profile**: Understand hiring trends by job roles, recruiters, and employment types.
- **Termination Profile**: Analyze reasons for terminations, overtime impact, and monthly involuntary term trends.
